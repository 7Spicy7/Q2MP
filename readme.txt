=========================
Fishing in Quake go brrr.
=========================

//////////////////////////
Installation instructions:
//////////////////////////

All that's really needed is the gamex86.dll file, which can be found in:
"game/release"

Once you have the gamex86.dll file, make a folder where you have all your
Quake II files, on the same level as the "baseq2" folder and things of the like.
Insert the gamex86.dll file into the new folder you've made.

After that, launch the game, then go to the pause menu. From there, go to:
Game -> mods
then scroll through the options until you see the name of the new folder that
you hade put the gamex86.dll file into, and launch it.

Gameplay:
/////////

In order to fish, you need the grenade launcher weapon, so you either
won't be playing the mod until you unlock it naturally, or, since you're
already modifying the game, just cheat some more and give yourself the
grenade launcher so you can start.

You fish by firing the launcher, but, of course, like in actual fishing,
you won't catch anything unless the launcher is shot at water (more accurately,
you won't catch anything unless the grenade itself is underwater when it explodes).

You can check your bestiary by typing "beast" into the console (I know it's not "beast-iary" don't @ me).
Fish you haven't caught will be listed as "???", while fish you have caught will have their common name and scientific binominal name.

You can sell the fish you get by typing "sell" into the console, and from there, you can buy one of 5* upgrades, being "line", "hook", "lure", "bait", and "luck" (by far the most expensive).
*if you want to get technical, 7 upgrades, as bait can be upgraded 3 times total, while the others only get 1 upgrade.
